Hello All, 
In this repository different types of visualization will be performed on data using R and Python.

## Using R

### Chart 1: ridgeline plot : 
The ridgeline plot allows to study the distribution of a numeric variable for several groups.

### Chart 2: Basic density chart: 
A density plot is a representation of the distribution of a numeric variable. It is a smoothed version of the histogram and is used in the same kind of situation. 

### Chart 3: Heat Map : 
A heatmap is a graphical representation of data where the individual values contained in a matrix are represented as colors.

### Chart 4: Connected scatterplot: 
connected scatterplot is basically an hybrid between a scatterplot and a lineplot.

### Chart #5: Background map :
It explains how to build static and interactive maps based on different input data, but does not explain how to plot data on it.
